# The differences between AI, ML, and DL ü§ñ

Have you ever heard the buzzwords artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, but weren't sure what they meant or how they differed from one another? If so, you're not alone! In this blog post, I'll be breaking down the definitions and differences between these three important terms.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) ü§ñ

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science that involves building intelligent machines that can think, learn, and act like humans. This includes everything from self-driving cars and smart watches to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. Non-intelligent machines, like wall clocks and analog watches, are not considered AI.

## Machine Learning (ML) üßë‚Äçüíº

Machine learning, or ML, is a technique used to implement AI. It allows machines to learn and adapt through experience and data without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of ML algorithms or techniques: 
- supervised, 
- unsupervised, 
- and reinforcement.  

An example of an ML application is using historical data to predict the weather.

## Deep Learning (DL) üíª

Deep learning, or DL, is a subfield of ML that uses artificial neural networks, or ANNs, to learn from data. These neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain and help machines learn how to solve complex problems.

</p>

Deep learning gets its name from the multiple hidden layers of ANNs that are used in this type of learning. 

Examples of DL applications include image captioning and text generation.

By understanding the definitions and differences between AI, ML, and DL, you'll be better equipped to navigate the exciting world of intelligent machines. ü§ñ
