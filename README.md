# Get Ready to Dive into Machine Learning: My 90-Day Journey 🚀

In this repository, I'll be sharing my journey as I learn machine learning, deep learning, math for ML and DL, statistics, and Python. My goal is to get a solid foundation in all of these subjects and build some mini projects in ML and DL over the next 90 days, while also dedicating 60 days to studying data structures and algorithms. 💪

Throughout this series, I'll be sharing my progress, insights, and any challenges I encounter as I focus on hands-on on both conceptual learning and practical learning using Python.

Whether you're a beginner or you're looking to refresh your skills, I hope my experiences and tips will be helpful to you. I'm excited to learn and grow with you on this journey! 🤗

## In the first week, I'll be covering the following topics:

- The differences between AI, ML, and DL 🤖
- The types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, etc. 🧑‍💼
- Python basics for ML: lists, comprehension lists, dictionaries, tuples, functions, OOPs, etc. 🐍
- Essential Python libraries for ML: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn 📊
- Data collection and pre-processing: sourcing data, handling missing values, working with imbalanced datasets, handling textual data, etc. 📈
- Real-world machine learning use cases: rock vs. mine prediction, diabetes prediction, spam mail prediction, etc. 💻

I'm excited to share my journey with you and learn together! 🤗
