    "### 🧑‍💼 Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like `print()`, `len()`, etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses `()` and a colon `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function body starts with an indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The syntax to create a function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"function_docstring\"\n",
    "    function_suite\n",
    "    return [expression]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling a function\n",
    "Once we have defined a function, we can call it from anywhere in the program. To call a function, we use the function name followed by a pair of parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "function_name(parameters)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Information can be passed to functions as function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of function arguments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Required arguments\n",
    "2. Keyword arguments\n",
    "3. Default arguments\n",
    "4. Variable-length arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returning a Value from a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To let a function return a value, use the `return` statement. The `return` statement can contain an expression that gets evaluated and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not want to return a value from a function, use the `pass` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    function_suite\n",
    "    return [expression]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "The first string after the function definition is called the docstring and is short for documentation string. It is used to explain in brief, what a function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"function_docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    function_suite\n",
    "    return [expression]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `pass` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "`pass` is a null statement. The difference between a comment and a pass statement in Python is that while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, nothing happens when `pass` is executed. It is used as a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function(args):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is commonly used when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking about the other parts of the program. Later, you can implement the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are anonymous functions in Python. They are small functions without a name. They are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by a list of arguments, a colon, and the function body. The syntax for defining a lambda function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, arguments is a list of arguments and expression is a single-line function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are used when you need a small function for a short period of time. They are usually used as an argument to a higher-order function (a function that takes in other functions as arguments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a lambda function that takes in two arguments and returns their sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "add(2, 3)\n",

    "Congratulations on making it to the end of this notebook! 🎉 In this notebook, we covered the fundamentals of Python which is required for machine learning and deep learning. We went over the basics of commenting, printing, variables and constants, data types, collections, user input, and operators. We also explored how to use conditionals and looping in our code, as well as how to define and use functions and lambda functions. Finally, we learned about list comprehension and how to use it to write concise and efficient code. \n",
